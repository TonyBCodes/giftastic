This app uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of various Volkswagen brands.

The app take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.  When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.  When the user clicks one of the still gif images, the gif animates. If clicked again, the gif stops playing.  Add a form to your page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your topics array.
